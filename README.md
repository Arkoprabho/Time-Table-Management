# Time-Table-Management
A time table management software, that allows easy access for its user to view their time table

# Introduction
As per the guidelines of the Software Engineering Lab, we were to submit a software so as to introduce us to the world of "Software Engineering". We are accomplishing this by creating a simple time table software that allows the users to view their time table. The viewing rights and permissions are as follows
  1. Any one can view the master time table
  2. Students after logging in can view their specific section's time table
  3. Faculty members, after logging in, can view their own time table and that of the students as well.
  4. Admin can view all the time tables, and can also modify them at the database level. A new time table can also be generated using efficient algorithms.
