# Guidelines
These guidelines need to be strictly followed during the programming and development of the project.

# Naming
All the naming conventions listed in the link - http://www.javatpoint.com/java-naming-conventions should be followed carefully and strictly.
Avoid using abbreviations as variable names. Use full names that indicate the purpose and the data type of the variable. Length of the variable name does not matter. No one types out the entire name. We have IDEs at our disposal. Use them

# Comments
Add and explain each and every thing. Do not over-comment. Try to explain others about your thinking and working as much as possible with comments. Use javadoc to better aid other developers.
